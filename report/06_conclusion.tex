\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The most advances \ac{CRF} models outperformed the \ac{WFST} models developed in the mid-term project, thanks to the discriminative nature that allowed to easily combine multiple features together.
On the other side, \ac{CRF} resulted much more difficult to train than \ac{WFST} due to the exponential number of possible feature functions combinations.
Some heuristics can be used to come up with good features, then optimization methods can help to select the best ones.
In particular, our genetic algorithm managed to generate a population of \ac{CRF} models which outperformed the best model trained by hand, reaching the F1 score of $84.15\%$.
