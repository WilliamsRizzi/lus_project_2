\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Concept tagging can be defined as the extraction of concepts out of a given word sequence,
where a concept represents the smallest unit of meaning that is relevant for a specific task.
The extracted concepts can be used by the following blocks of a \ac{SLU} pipeline, like a dialog management system, to understand the semantic of user's requests and build a appropriate replies.

In this work, we trained \ac{CRF} classifiers to extract concepts sentences in the movie domain, build using
the \texttt{CRF++}\footnote{\url{https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/}} toolkit.
We will give a brief description of \ac{CRF} models.
Then, we will present the data set and the features used for the classification.
We will present the different experiments performed and the obtained results.
Finally, we will compare the \ac{CRF} to the \ac{WFST} models of the mid-term project.
